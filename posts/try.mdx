## Prepare Your TailwindCSS Config File
Recently I built a typing speed test website with React.js and TailwindCSS. I wanted to add a dark mode feature to the site, but I didn't want to use the `<ThemeProvider>` component from styled-components. I wanted to use TailwindCSS classes to toggle between light and dark mode. After some research, I found a way to do this. In this article, I will show you how to do this.
